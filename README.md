# ECT-imaging-pipeline
This repository contains the pipeline for uniform preprocessing, quality control and processing for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) imaging data acquired in Rijnstate hospital Arnhem and UMC Amsterdam. Furthermore, we provide documentation on the pipeline and example pieces of text that describe the analysis for your manuscript. 

## Datasets, -types and -timepoints
Multiple ECT-imaging datasets were acquired:
* Seizure threshold dataset
     * This dataset was acquired in order to study neuroimaging and clinical predictors of seizure threshold in ECT. The study acquired the following modalities:
        *  Clinical data was acquired pre- and post-ECT. You can find a clinical description of the sample [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-012-0342-7/tables/1). 
        *  Structural MRIs were acquired pre-ECT. Acquisition parameters can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X12002094?casa_token=cAC-WLm3LVcAAAAA:gm4tDvav6UkNTPFnTLWB_7c2fY4bnB_o-BNe3HnInR2mOL0qw0iFPD7MNEdiymz7QwEy4v7DvGk)
        *  Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was acquired pre-ECT. Acquisition parameters can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201478).
