# Preprocessing


## sMRI & rs-fMRI
We used [FMRIprep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/), i.e., a standardized state-of-the-art pipeline for sMRI and rs-fMRI. FMRIprep can simultaneously apply Freesurfer's recon-all, which is a brain parcelation analysis (used to establish brain volumes, cortical thickness, etc).

## DTI
The equivalent of FMRIprep for _Q-space imaging_ (e.g., DTI) is [QSIprep](https://qsiprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Aside from preprocessing the data, this pipeline is able to establish probabilistic tractography (i.e., structural connectivity).
